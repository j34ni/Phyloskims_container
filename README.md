Phyloskims_container

This is a Dockerfile based on Ubuntu22.04 tu run Phyloskims, based on the original recipe from 2023
(https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/eric.coissac/phyloskim) modified so that it could still
be build in 2024/06/15.

Only the recipe (to sort out ambiguities and resolve conflicts), the source code for the software itself
was not modified. All the executables are located in /org-assembler and /bin
