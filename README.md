# Phyloskims container

This is a Dockerfile based on Ubuntu22.04 tu run Phyloskims, it it a modified version of the original recipe from https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/eric.coissac/phyloskim so that it could still
be build in 2024/06/15.

Only the recipe has been updated (to sort out ambiguities and resolve conflicts), the source code for the software itself was not modified and all the executables are located in /org-assembler and /bin.
